REMEMBER THAT DISCORD BOT TOKEN IS DIFFERENT FROM EVERYONE, IT IS A UNIQUE TOKEN THAT SHOULDNT BE ALLOWED TO BE SHARED PUBLICLY


This Python code provides a simple chatbot functionality with specific commands. The chatbot responds to various messages, including greetings, dice rolling, help requests, and mathematical expressions. Additionally, it supports vector operations like addition, subtraction, and scaling.

How to Use:

1 Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

2 Copy and paste the code into a Python file (e.g., chatbot.py).

3 Run the Python script.

4 Send messages to the chatbot and receive responses.

1 Greetings

2 Send a message containing 'hello' to receive a special greeting from the hydro archon.

3 Dice Rolling

1 Send the command '!help' to receive a help message (modifiable).



Mathematical Expressions

Send mathematical expressions with the commands '!add', '!sub', '!mul', '!div'.

Example: !add 2 + 3

Vector Operations

Send vector operations using commands like 'vector add', 'vector subtract', 'vector scale'.

Example: vector add 1,2,3 4,5,6

EXAMPLE FUNCTIONS
message = "hello"
response = get_response(message)
print(response)

message = "!dice"
response = get_response(message)
print(response)

message = "!help"
response = get_response(message)
print(response)

message = "!add 2 + 3"
response = get_response(message)
print(response)

message = "vector add 1,2,3 4,5,6"
response = get_response(message)
print(response)


Notes
Modify the help message in the !help command according to your needs.
Ensure proper syntax for mathematical and vector commands.
Feel free to customize the code and experiment with different messages and commands!
